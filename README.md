# FlashAlloc: Dedicating Flash Blocks By Objects

**FlashAlloc** is a novel interfacee for flash storage,
which is used to the logical address ranges of objects to the underlying flash device 
and thus to enlighten the device to stream writes by objects. See deatil in our paper

## Prerequisite

First, you will need the Cosmos+ Board with hynix NAND firmware version. 
You can get more accurate information at [CRZ Technology](https://www.crz-tech.com/)   

![Cosmos+Board](https://www.crz-tech.com/uploads/uploads/2021/01/29/fnn45201781714615.jpg)

```
FPGA: Xilinx XC7Z045-3FFG900 Zynq-7000
- Dual ARM Cortex-A9 1GHz Core
- NEON DSP co-processor for each core
- 350K LCs

1GB DDR3 DRAM Modules
1 SD CARD Slot
Dual PCIe Gen2 x8 End-Points (Cabled PCIe Interface)
1 Gigabit Ethernet Interface
1 USB 2.0 (configurable to Host or Device)
JTAG and Debug Interface         
```

Second, You need the software tools and files
- Xilinx ISE design suite 19.1 system edition [Link](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-design-tools/archive.html)
- UART terminal emulator software (Xilinx Software Development Kit(SDK) includes UART terminal)
- Download the [USB-to-UART driver](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
- Check details at [OpenSSD Project hompage](http://www.openssd-project.org/)

## Project Structure
- `Flashalloc` is Cosmos+ OpenSSD firmware source code which implements the Flashalloc interface for flash storages
- `Multistream` is multi-stream prototype for Cosmos+ OpenSSD supporting eight stream-ids
- `host` incorporates the implementation of both RocksDB and MySQL, utilized for evaluation in our paper. 
It also includes a simple host application example to test the flashalloc command.
-  More details are illustrated in our paper.

## Build

Please refer to Cosmos+ OpenSSD build guide [document](doc/Cosmos+OpenSSD-2017-Tutorial.pdf)

TL;DR
1. Prepare Cosmos+ Open SSD, Window and Linux PC
2. Connect the  Cosmos+ OpenSSD to Window PC (JTAG dilegent module and USB cable for UART) and install the PCIe to connect btw Cosmos+ OpenSSD and Linux PC
3. Open the FlashAlloc projecct in Xilinx SDK
4. Right click on project, and `Run As > 1. Launch on Hardware (GDB)`
5. Click the firmware to execute, and `click OK > wait UART message`
6. Press X to make bad block table (you should do this for the first time)
7. Wait and Turn-on (or reboot) the Linux PC
8. You can check the Cosmos+ OpenSSD using `nvme-cli` or `lspci` command (check the `nvme0nXXXXX` in the device list)
9. Bon app√©tit! :)

## How to use `FlashAlloc` command

```
cd host
make -j

sudo ./playground /dev/nvmeXXX 0 32
```

- `playground` host application name
- `/dev/nvmeXXX` Comsmos+ OpenSSD device path
- `0` start LBA (4KiB-based offset)
- `32` LBA length
  
## Running the Experiments

### RocksDB

1. Build

- Build the RocksDB database engine for both flashalloc or multi-streame ssd version
- You can also build the vanilla version of Rocksdb using `bash ./scripts/build.sh` command

```

cd host/RocksDB/rocksdb-{flashalloc | msssd}
bash ./scripts/build.sh cosmos

```

2. Configure File system

- You can mount either EXT4 or F2FS filesystem with TRIM support on top of Cosmos+ OpenSSD

```
# EXT4 Filesystem
bash ./scripts/setup-ext4-trim.sh

# F2FS Filesystem
bash ./scripts/setup-f2fs-trim.sh
```

3. Run `db_bench` wiht 4 tenants

```
# FlashAlloc version
bash ./scripts/run_flashalloc.sh

# Vanilla version
bash ./scripts/run_vanilla.sh

# Multi-stream SSD version
bash ./scripts/run_msssd.sh
```

4. Run `db_bench` wiht single tenants

```
# FlashAlloc version
bash ./scripts/falloc-single.sh

# Multi-stream SSD version
bash ./scripts/msssd-single.sh
```

### MySQL

1. Build
```
cd hsot/MySQL
bash ./build.sh
```

2. Initialize data directory

```
bash init.sh
```

3. Run MySQL server

```
bash ./run.sh
```

4. Run TPC-C Benchmark

- You can also modify the configuration for TPC-C Benchmark (e.g., # of clients, wrapup time, duration, and etc)
- To run the either vanilla or multi-stream ssd version, you can execute `run.sh` script.

```
cd host/tpcc-mysql
bash ./run-flashalloc.sh
```

### Multi-tenant

- In this experiment, you can evaluate the multi-tenant configuration.
```
# configure the filesystem and data directory for TPC-C and db_bench
bash ./setup-multi.sh

# run multi-tenant experiments
bash run-multi.sh
```
